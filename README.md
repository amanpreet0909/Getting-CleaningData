Getting-CleaningData
====================
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate your ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. 
The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis.
This repo contains:
1) a tidy data s
2) script for performing the analysis
3) a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations  performed to clean up the 
data called CodeBook.md. 
4) README
This repo explains how all of the scripts work and how they are connected.
